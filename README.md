For the original project see: [https://github.com/oscarmorrison/oscar-ghost](https://github.com/oscarmorrison/oscar-ghost)

## Introduction
The **Oscar Ghost** Theme is a clean, simple, minimalistic theme built for ghost. The theme is built from an original 
fork of the [Lanyon-Ghost](https://github.com/PxlBuzzard/lanyon-ghost) Theme. 

This theme is ideal for single author, tag heavy, looking for a simple design, with code highlighting. 

## Features
- [Prism.js](http://prismjs.com) Code Highlighting (Bash, Swift, JS, C, ...)
- Font: [Lato](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Lato) weights 100,300,300italic
- Automatic internal and external linking
- Featured Image on Posts
- Custom Tag Home Page
- Tag Styling
- Single Author (no Author on Posts)
- Gallery Viewer ([Photoswipe](http://photoswipe.com/)) ([#10](https://github.com/oscarmorrison/oscar-ghost/issues/10))
- Custom Gallery Post Listing


## Customization

the original theme from Oscar Morrison was modified to suffice some of my needs

 * created a custom navigation.hbs which has no english texts in it, so the theme is kind of internationalized
 * changed the date-format to DD.MM.YYYY , so the theme can be used/viewed by non-US and non-english persons without having to be annoyed
 * the arrows of between-articles-navigation now uses the same arrows as the between-pages-of-articles-navigation
 * changed the color of external links to my prefered green :)
 * changed the menu/navigation from icons to right aligned text
 * changed the behaviour of the navigation, it now shows only on overview-pages (startpage and tags-page) but not on article pages
 * images dont have round corners anymore
